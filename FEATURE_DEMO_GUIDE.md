## Tips and Tricks

### Efficient Workout Planning
- **Set realistic weights**: Start lower and increase gradually
- **Rest periods matter**: 
  - 30-60 seconds for endurance
  - 60-90 seconds for hypertrophy
  - 2-5 minutes for strength
- **Use notes wisely**: Add specific cues or technique reminders

### Exercise Organization
- Add exercises in the order you plan to perform them
- Group similar exercises together (e.g., all chest exercises)
- Consider adding warm-up exercises first

### Weight Tracking
- Start with 0 kg for bodyweight exercises
- Record the actual weight you plan to use
- Update as you progress over time

### Using Notes Effectively
Examples of useful notes:
- "Tempo: 3-1-1-1"
- "Use decline bench"
- "Superset with pull-ups"
- "Focus on mind-muscle connection"
